A transformer (eva-02) based model for detecting AI art. If it detects AI art, it'll also run a AI model classifier for which AI generator it's likely to have been generated with. Can upload a batch of up to ten images at a time to the serverless API for inference.

Check out the public inference Gradio app at https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-config-reference
